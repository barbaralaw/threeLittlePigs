    <div class="story">
      <h2>Once upon a time there were three little pigs.</h2>

        <p>
          As these little pigs came of age, they were confronted by Mother Pig,
          who had just been on a tough-love self-help book kick. She squealed
          sternly, "It's time you went out in the world and fended for
          yourselves!"
          <br />
          The pigs were startled and nervous to start their new life. But
          knowing better than to disappoint mother, the Three Little Pigs set
          course for their new lives.
        </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he
        built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit
        harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of
        sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the
        day.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with
        bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and
        chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.
      </p>
      <div class="brickHouse">

          class="imgScale pig3 house"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little
        pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside.
        He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to
        water.

        <p>So he knocked on the door and said:</p>
        <h2>Little pig! Little pig! Let me in!</h2>
        <p>
          But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he
          answered back:
        </p>
        <h2>No! No! No! Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!</h2>
        <p>Then the wolf showed his teeth and said:</p>
        <h2>
          Then I'll huff <br />
          and I'll puff <br />and I'll blow your house down!
        </h2>

        </div>
        <p>
          So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! As the hut
          collapsed into a pile of hay, the wolf opened his jaws very wide and
          bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran
          away to hide with the second little pig.

          The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house
          made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside,
          and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they
          would make.

        <h2>Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in!</h2>
        <p>
          But the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so
          they answered back:
        </p>
        <h2>No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!</h2>

        <p>
          So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! As the cabin
          collapsed into a pile of sticks, the wolf was greedy and he tried to
          catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His
          big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs
          scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.

      <div class="huffPuffBricks">
        <p>
          The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they
          made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf
          could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened,
          they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true.
          The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite
          chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them
          inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely
          feast.
        </p>
        <p>So he knocked on the door and said:</p>
        <h2>Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in!</h2>
        <p>
          But the little pigs saw the wolf's glowing eyes through the keyhole,
          so they answered back:
        </p>
        <h2>No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!</h2>
        <p>Then the wolf showed his teeth and said:</p>
        <h2>
          Then I'll huff <br />
          and I'll puff <br />and I'll blow your house down!

        <p>
          Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed,
          huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down.
          At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't
          puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.
        </p>
        <img src="img/png/035-sleep.png" alt="" /><img

        />

        <p>
          But this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he
          would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a
          blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil.
        </p>
        <img src="img/png/031-pot.png" alt="A hot cauldron" />
        <p>
          Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy
          pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding
          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and
          the three little pigs ate him for supper.
