          As these little pigs came of age, they were confronted by Mother Pig,
          who had just been on a tough-love self-help book kick. She squealed
          sternly, "It's time you went out in the world and fended for
          yourselves!"
          <br />
          The pigs were startled and nervous to start their new life. But
          knowing better than to disappoint mother, the Three Little Pigs set
          course for their new lives.

        The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he
        built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit
        harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of
        sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the
        day.

        The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with
        bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and
        chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

      <p>
        The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little
        pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside.
        He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to
        water.
